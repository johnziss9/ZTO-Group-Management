# ZTO-Group-Management

This is part of a ASP.Net Core tutorial I am following from an online blog of someone who is showing the different features of ASP.Net Core by building an application from scratch.

The application is for arranging a sports game such as football, basketball, etc between friends that will record statistics, show live data, manage users and groups and many more.

This repository is based on the Groom Management of the application.

The beginning of the tutorial I am following is found below:
